> An implementation of [@neoxr/wb](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@neoxr/wb) which has been optimized to be lightweigth.

> A little recoding

### Requirements

- [x] NodeJS >=v14
- [x] FFMPEG
- [x] Server vCPU/RAM 1/2GB (Min)

### Configuration

There are 3 configuration files namely ```.env```, ```config.js``` and ```config.json```, adjust them before installing.

```Javascript
{
   "owner": "6285815700861",
   "owner_name": "alya",
   "database": "data",
   "limit": 15,
   "ram_limit": "900mb",
   "max_upload": 50,
   "max_upload_free": 10,
   "cooldown": 3,
   "timer": 180000,
   "timeout": 1800000,
   "blocks": ["994", "91", "92"],
   "evaluate_chars":  ["=>", "~>", "<", ">", "$"],
   "pairing": {
     "state": false // true if you want to login with code
     "number": 6281000 // bot number
   }
}
```

```Javascript
global.APIs = {
   alya: 'https://api.alyachan.pro'
}
global.APIKeys = {
   'https://api.alyachan.pro': 'yourkey'
}
```

```.env
### Database : https://www.mongodb.com/
DATABASE_URL = ''

### Timezone (Important)
TZ = 'Asia/Jakarta'
```

**Notes** :
+ ```ram_limit``` : ram usage limit, for example you have a server with 1gb of ram set before the maximum capacity is 900mb.

+ ```global.APIKeys``` : some of the features in this script use apikey, especially the downloader feature, to get an apiKey you can get it on the [Alyachan Api's](https://api.alyachan.pro) with prices that vary according to your needs.

+ ```DATABASE_URL``` : can be filled with mongo and postgresql URLs to use localdb just leave it blank and the data will be saved to the .json file.

### Installation & Run

Make sure the configuration and server meet the requirements so that there are no problems during installation or when this bot is running, type this on your console :

```
$ yarn
$ node .
```

or want to use pm2

```
$ yarn
$ npm i -g pm2
$ pm2 start index.js && pm2 save && pm2 logs
```

### Command Plugin

**Command Plugin** is a plugin that will run using the command.

```Javascript
exports.run = {
   usage: ['mediafire'],
   hidden: ['mf'],
   use: 'link',
   category: 'downloader',
   async: async (m, {
      client,
      args,
      text,
      isPrefix,
      command,
      env,
      Scraper,
      Func
   }) => {
      try {
         // do something
      } catch (e) {
         console.log(e)
         client.reply(m.chat, Func.jsonFormat(e), m)
      }
   },
   error: false,
   limit: true,
   restrict: true,
   cache: true,
   location: __filename
}
```

#### Up Side Options :

+ ```text``` : input that is given after command in the form of a string is usually found in search features that use queries/keywords such as lyrics, chords, yts, etc.

+ ```isPrefix``` : prefix used, if noprefix mode is active this parameter will be blank (it's no problem).

+ ```command``` : commands used can be used in an if else or switch case conditional when creating 1 plugin with several commands in it.

cmd.async(m, { client, args, text, isPrefix: prefix, prefixes, command, groupMetadata, participants, users, chats, groupSet, setting, isOwner, isAdmin, isBotAdmin, plugins, blockList, env, ctx, Func, Scraper })
```

### Event Plugin

**Event Plugin** is a plugin that runs automatically without using the command.

```Javascript
exports.run = {
   async: async (m, {
      client,
      body,
      prefixes
   }) => {
      try {
         // do something
      } catch (e) {
         return client.reply(m.chat, Func.jsonFormat(e), m)
      }
   },
   error: false,
   cache: true,
   location: __filename
}
```

+ ```body``` : chat in the form of text or emoticons, this plugin is usually used for auto response or group protectors such as anti-links, anti-toxic etc.

+ ```prefixes``` : parameter which contains all prefixes in the form of an array, to use them parse based on index. (Example: prefixes[0]).

**Other** :
```Javascript
event.async(m, { client, body, prefixes, groupMetadata, participants, users, chats, groupSet, setting, isOwner, isAdmin, isBotAdmin, plugins, blockList, env, ctx, Func, Scraper })
```
